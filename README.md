# MEAN Stack for Quilt.js
The MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and node.js) is a popular fullstack
JavaScript framework used for web development. Deploying a flexible, multi-node
MEAN stack app can be both time consuming and costly, but Quilt simplifies this
process. Below, we walk through how to deploy your application in the cloud
using Quilt.

## Deploying your MEAN stack app with Quilt
This repository already contains all the code needed for deploying the multi-node
MEAN stack. The current code deploys a todo app, but we want to change it to
deploy our very simple example app, `awesome-restaurant-app`, located in
[github.com/luise/awesome-restaurant-app](https://github.com/luise/awesome-restaurant-app.git).

To do this, we just have to tweak a single line of code in
[`mean.js`](./mean.js)

### How to

##### Our app
First, we make sure that our MongoDB connection URI is set to the `MONGO_URI`
environment variable. Note that this is set in our MEAN app code, not the
Quilt.js specs:

```javascript
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI);
```

This is already done in the `awesome-restaurant-app`, but you'll need to
do something similar to your own MEAN app before deploying it with Quilt.

For an example, see how [server.js](https://github.com/luise/awesome-restaurant-app/blob/master/server.js#L10)
in the `awesome-restaurant-app` uses the URI in [config/database.js](https://github.com/luise/awesome-restaurant-app/blob/master/config/database.js) to connect to MongoDB.

##### mean.js
The `Node` constructor called in [`mean.js`](./mean.js) takes a string
`repo` which specifies the git repository containing the Node application to
deploy. Let's change this URL to point to our restaurant app:

```javascript
var app = new Node({
  ...
  repo: "https://github.com/luise/awesome-restaurant-app.git",
  ...
});
```

Finally, before we deploy our MEAN stack, let's set the `sshKeys` property to
be our GitHub username instead of `ejj`. This way we can ssh into the VMs in
our deployment using any ssh key associated with our GitHub profile.

```javascript
var baseMachine = new Machine({
    ...
    sshKeys: githubKeys("ejj"),
});
```

If you want to change the characteristics of the VMs, go ahead and modify the
relevant properties of the `baseMachine` object.

##### Deploy
Now we're ready to deploy our MEAN stack application! If you haven't already
worked through [Quilt's Getting Started guide](https://github.com/NetSys/quilt/blob/master/docs/GettingStarted.md)
guide, now is a good time to check it out and set up your `GOPATH` and
`QUILT_PATH`, and `quilt get` the Quilt specs.

When you're set up, run `quilt daemon` in one shell, and then run
`quilt run ./mean.js` from the `mean` directory in another shell. If successful,
the `quilt run` command has no output, while the daemon will output logs
similar to this:

```
$ quilt daemon
INFO [Feb 17 16:23:59.181] db.Cluster:
	Cluster-1{}
INFO [Feb 17 16:23:59.184] db.Machine:
	Machine-2{c14105b79bb167a088cf1ae8c9169b51deb6b29f, Master, Amazon us-west-1 m4.large, Disk=32GB}
	Machine-3{89d34da8fde90ce26650c0629f22e2c9e48b8f46, Worker, Amazon us-west-1 m4.large, Disk=32GB}
	...
```

You can see the status of the system with the command `quilt ps`. The system is
fully booted when the `STATUS`es of all containers are `running`:

```
CONTAINER       MACHINE         COMMAND                                 LABELS      STATUS     CREATED               PUBLIC IP
7101084e12ab    89d34da8fde9    node-app:awesome-restaurant-app.git     app         running    About a minute ago
957596e1beed    89d34da8fde9    haproxy:1.6.4                           hap         running    About a minute ago    54.241.174.139:80
c8e5464625e0    89d34da8fde9    quilt/mongo                             mongo       running    About a minute ago

4d3d6be15985    a2077202355d    haproxy:1.6.4                           hap         running    About a minute ago    54.193.9.14:80
...
```

##### Access Web App
We can now access our web app by using the public IP address of any of our VMs
that are hosting a proxy container. The above output from `quilt ps` shows us
that we can access the web app at `54.241.174.139` and `54.193.9.14`.

Now, simply go to `http://PROXY_PUBLIC_IP:80` in your browser. As you see, our
app is up!

##### Shut Down VMs
To shut down our application and VMs, run `quilt stop`, and wait for the message
`Successfully halted machines.` in the quilt daemon output.
